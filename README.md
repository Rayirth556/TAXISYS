# TAXISYS
MS Excel is an excellent spreadsheet application that is used by almost everyone at some point in their lives, especially professionally. Having to enter data and then analysing it based on their dependency on each other are two separate tasks that is aimed to gap through our project: TAXISYS, a Greek word which means organized system.

A web-based service for real-time spreadsheet integration through a form-like interface. Entering data for multiple columned spreadsheets through a form, which then recognises the numerical columns and runs a machine learning algorithm to form relations between them based on even intervals. Also having features for finding individual data and live editing, of the spreadsheet, through the webpage.
